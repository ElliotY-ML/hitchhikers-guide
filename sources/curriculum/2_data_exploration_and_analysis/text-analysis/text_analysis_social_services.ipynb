    "# Text Analysis\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text analysis** is used to extract useful information from or summarize a large amount of unstructured text stored in documents. This opens up the opportunity of using text data alongside more conventional data sources (e.g. surveys and administrative data). The goal of text analysis is to take a large corpus of complex and unstructured text data and extract important and meaningful messages in a comprehensible way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Text analysis can help with the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Information Retrieval**: Find relevant information in a large database, such as a systematic literature review, that would be very time-consuming for humans to do manually. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clustering and Text Categorization**: Summarize a large corpus of text by finding the most important phrases, using methods like topic modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text Summarization**: Create category-sensitive text summaries of a large corpus of text. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Machine Translation**: Translate documents from one language to another. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are going to analyze social services descriptions using topic modeling to examine the content of our data and document classification to tag the type of job in the advertisement. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Outcomes\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will...\n",
    "* Learn how to transform a corpus of text into a structured matrix format so that we can apply natural language processing (NLP) methods\n",
    "* Learn the basics and applications of topic modeling\n",
    "* Learn how to do document tagging and evaluate the results\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## Glossary of Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Corpus**: A corpus is the set of all text documents used in your analysis; for example, your corpus of text may include hundreds of research articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tokenize**: Tokenization is the process by which text is separated into meaningful terms or phrases. In English this is easy to do for individual words, as they are separated by whitespace; however, it can get more complicated to  automate determining which groups of words constitute meaningful phrases. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stemming**: Stemming is normalizing text by reducing all forms or conjugations of a word to the word's most basic form. In English, this can mean making a rule of removing the suffixes \"ed\" or \"ing\" from the end of all words, but it gets more complex. For example, \"to go\" is irregular, so you need to tell the algorithm that \"went\" and \"goes\" stem from a common lemma, and should be considered alternate forms of the word \"go.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **TF-IDF**: TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) is an example of feature engineering where the most important words are extracted by taking account their frequency in documents and the entire corpus of documents as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Topic Modeling**: Topic modeling is an unsupervised learning method where groups of words that often appear together are clustered into topics. Typically, the words in one topic should be related and make sense (e.g. boat, ship, captain). Individual documents can fall under one topic or multiple topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **LDA**: LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) is a type of probabilistic model commonly used for topic modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stop Words**: Stop words are words that have little semantic meaning but occur very frequently, like prepositions, articles and common nouns. For example, every document (in English) will probably contain the words \"and\" and \"the\" many times. You will often remove them as part of preprocessing using a list of stop words.\n"

    "We are going to apply topic modeling, an unsupervised learning method, to our corpus to find the high-level topics in our corpus as a \"first go\" for exploring our data. Through this process, we'll discuss how to clean and preprocess our data to get the best results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modeling is a broad subfield of machine learning and natural language processing. We are going to focus on a common modeling approach called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). \n",
    "\n",
    "To use topic modeling, we first have to assume that topics exist in our corpus, and that some small number of these topics can \"explain\" the corpus. Topics in this context refer to words from the corpus, in a list that is ranked by probability. A single document can be explained by multiple topics. For instance, an article on net neutrality would fall under the topic \"technology\" as well as the topic \"politics.\" The set of topics used by a document is known as the document's allocation, hence, the name Latent Dirchlet Allocation, each document has an allocation of latent topics allocated by Dirchlet distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Processing Text Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The first important step in working with text data is cleaning and processing the data, which includes (but is not limited to) *forming a corpus of text, tokenization, removing stop-words, finding words co-located together (N-grams), and stemming and lemmatization*. Each of these steps will be discussed below. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate goal is to transform our text data into a form an algorithm can work with, because a document or a corpus of text cannot be fed directly into an algorithm. Algorithms expect numerical feature vectors with certain fixed sizes, and can't handle documents, which are basically sequences of symbols with variable length. We will be transforming our text corpus into a *bag of n-grams* to be further analyzed. In this form our text data is represented as a matrix where each row refers to a specific job description (document) and each column is the occurence of a word (feature).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bag of N-gram Representation Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, we want to take our collection of documents, corpus, and convert it into a matrix. Fortunately, `sklearn` has a pre-built object, `CountVectorizer`, that can tokenize, eliminate stopwords, identify n-grams, and stem our corpus, and output a matrix in one step. Before we apply the vectorizer to our corpus of data, let's apply it to a toy example so that we see what the output looks like and how a bag of words is represented. "

In order to remain faithful to our mission, Catholic Charities is guided by these core values: Respect, Compassion, Competence and Stewardship.\\n\\nOur mission and values are based on the firm foundation of Catholic Social Teaching, a collection of themes developed in papal and other writings over the course of the Church’s history. These themes include the belief that human life is sacred; that all humans have inherent dignity, rights and responsibilities; that social structures like marriage and the family must be supported; that the needs of the poor and vulnerable must be met; and that we must be responsible stewards of God’s creation.\\n\\nFar from limiting our focus, our Catholic identity and values enable us to truly be “universal,” which is what “catholic” really means. The tenets of Catholic Social Teaching call us to serve everyone, regardless of their belief or background, and to employ anyone, not just Catholics, who commits to our mission. Christ reached out to people of all faiths, and Catholic Charities does the same, with the goal of transforming lives for the better. About Us:  Who We Are What We Do Our Supporters ',\n",

       "       'Secondary menu Project: VISION Main menu  Who We Are  our background and our purpose Project: VISION was an idea conceived by a group of young professionals, students, and volunteers who saw a need for community youth to have a place to call their own. In Fall 2004, with the help of a few volunteers and borrowed space from the Chicago Public Library and Valentine Boys and Girls Club in Bridgeport, Project: VISION piloted its first tutoring program. Since then, our programs have reached over 500 youths, while remaining primarily volunteer-run and continuing to provide all programs free to youth. It’s a common misconception that Asian American students already excel academically, and therefore, these communities have little need for tutoring and after school programs. The truth is, every community has an underserved population and we are no exception. Who We Serve Our youth are between the ages of 12 and 21 from the Chinatown, Bridgeport, and surrounding neighborhoods. 96%  Chinese American, reflecting the area’s demographics 96%  are enrolled in Chicago Public Schools 90%  are from first-generation immigrant families 70%  would be the first in their families to attend college © Copyright 2005 - 2017 Project: VISION, Inc. 236 W 22nd Place Unit 1, Chicago, IL 60616 | (312) 808-1898 | staff@ProjectVisionChicago.org Site Map | Privacy Policy ',\n",

Our mission reflects the far-reaching impact of our programs and services in building stronger and healthier communities. We envisioned more vibrant and compassionate neighborhoods where the Y is seen as an essential leader in making our city a world-class place to live and raise a family. To achieve this, we adopted a bold Strategic Plan that positioned our 23 centers, five camps and hundreds of extension sites to meet the changing needs of the more than 200,000 members we serve every year. We also reshaped the focus of our programs and services and established a Learning & Evaluation department to advance four key mission anchors: academic readiness, character development, violence prevention and fitness and healthy living. Your partnership makes all this and so much more possible. We hope you enjoy reading about the difference your support is making in the lives of children, individuals and families in the community.

We promise to  address any issues with responsive solutions and aim to exceed your  expectations. Please be sure to fill out a comment form at the Member Service  Desk and share your feedback with us! \\xa0  ABOUT  YOUR MEMBERSHIP MEMBERSHIP CATEGORIES  The  YMCA of Metro Chicago offers several membership categories to meet the needs of  the communities we serve: MEMBERSHIP DUES  Membership  dues can be paid in one of two ways: MEMBERSHIP CARD  Your  YMCA membership card is a passport. It verifies your agreement to receive the  benefits of membership and to abide by the rules and policies of the YMCA of  Metro Chicago. Please present your membership card each time you enter the  facility and when registering for programs in order to avoid delays. Lost cards  may be replaced at your Center for a nominal fee. MEMBERSHIP HOLDS  Members in good standing of the YMCA of Metro Chicago can place their membership on hold for up to three (3) continuous months, once in a twelve (12) month period. The member must come into the Center 5 business days before the requested hold date. Stop by the membership desk at your Center for details. MOVING  When transferring an annual membership from another YMCA, we  will contact your previous YMCA for a prorated balance of your membership. Our  membership department will gladly honor your credit and apply this amount to  your first year’s dues, subject to the policies of your previous YMCA. You will  not be responsible for the joiner’s fee if your transfer occurs within 30 days  of membership expiration. MEMBERSHIP CANCELLATION As a member of the YMCA of Metro Chicago, you can cancel your membership at any time by giving the YMCA a minimum of 5 business days notice. The cancellation may be made in person, by fax, postal mail, or email with receipt of confirmation. If you participate in a membership draft payment plan, the YMCA will continue to draft until you cancel the membership as provided above. Your membership cancellation will be effective as of your next billing cycle. We cannot refund the prepaid portion of your membership. Cancellation of membership is not necessarily cancellation of Annual Fund deductions and vice versa. A.W.A.Y. PROGRAM  The  A.W.A.Y. (Always Welcome at YMCAs) Program allows you access to more than 2,300  YMCAs across the United States and in 130 countries and territories around the  world. Visiting members are always welcome by showing their YMCA A.W.A.Y. membership  card. Some local restrictions apply. Please call ahead prior to your first  visit. Check out www.ymca.net for the nearest YMCA you are planning to visit. RECIPROCITY  The  YMCA of Metro Chicago allows its members to use other YMCAs within the  Association at no additional charge. Members are encouraged to join the YMCA  that they most often use.  AGE GUIDELINES  Youth age 7 and under must be directly supervised by a parent/guardian whenever they are in a YMCA facility (except when participating in a structured program/activity with Y staff). Youth ages 8-10 may be unaccompanied by parent/guardian in specifically designated areas of the facility that are monitored by Y staff (call or stop by your center's member services desk for a list of designated areas). However, the parent/guardian must be physically present somewhere in the facility. Alternatively, parents/guardians may designate an individual caregiver (in writing) aged 11 or older to be physically present in the facility in place of the parents/guardians. The designated caregiver must have a valid membership. However, youth ages 8-10 don't need a parent/guardian or designated caregiver to be physically present in the facility if they're involved in a structured activity that is supervised by Y staff. To be in one of our pools, youth must pass a deep water swim test. Youth ages 11–17 may be in the facility without a parent/guardian. Parents/guardians do not have to be physically present elsewhere in the facility. Youth age 12 and under may only use fitness center and equipment when engaged in a YMCA program. Youth 8-12 years old may attend select group fitness classes with a parent or guardian actively supervising. Youth 13-15 years old may use the facility on their own after completing a Fitness Orientation. Certain equipment may be excluded. Youth 13-15 years old may attend group fitness classes, unless the class is specifically noted for 16+ years of age. Youth 16 + may use the fitness center, equipment and group exercise classes. GUEST PASSESTry the Y Today!  The YMCA of Metro Chicago provides guests the opportunity to try the Y!  Guests may visit your Center Website for branch specific guest policies.  Each guest is limited to three visits per calendar year and then may purchase a membership.  Guests must be 11 years old or older to be or bring a guest. All guests must present a valid ID and sign a facility waiver. Facility waiver must be signed by a parent or guardian for ages under 18 years old. CLOSURES AND CANCELLATIONS IN INCLEMENT WEATHER\\xa0 While the Y will make every attempt to open or remain open in inclement weather, it reserves the right to delay opening, close early, or remain closed if the weather is serious enough to put our staff and members at risk. Further, if a paid program is canceled because of a closure, the class will typically be offered at a make-up day and time. If circumstances prohibit a make-up class from being held, the Y may prorate a program registrant's class rate to reflect the actual classes offered for that session, if requested. \\xa0  CONDUCT CODE OF CONDUCT  As YMCA members, it is important to remember  that we share our facilities with young children, teens and people of all  backgrounds. We can make the YMCA a positive place for all by demonstrating the  YMCA core values of caring, honesty, respect and responsibility. Members are  expected to exhibit appropriate behaviors at all times: The YMCA of Metro Chicago reserves the right to suspend or cancel a membership  if a member’s behavior or language is judged to be in conflict with the welfare  of other members or staff, or in conflict with the YMCA’s mission. CELL PHONE POLICY  Due to the advances in cell phone and video/picture technology and for the privacy of our members and guests: Cell phones may not be used in locker rooms, bathrooms, or childcare rooms. Use of cameras and other video/picture capturing devices is also restricted. Posting of images taken at the YMCA is prohibited without permission of the Executive Director. If you must utilize a cell phone, please be courteous and keep your phone on “vibrate” or a very quiet ring tone, and keep your conversations short and as quiet as possible. If family or friends need to contact you due to an emergency, they may call the Center’s main number and a representative will page you or make every effort to locate you immediately. If a call must be answered, please do so discreetly and move to a designated area to complete the call. Again, in an effort to protect the privacy of our members and guests, anyone who violates this policy will be asked to move to the lobby or designated area. If a member or guest continues to violate this policy or posts images, their privileges and/or membership may be revoked. CRIMINAL  BEHAVIOR POLICY The YMCA reserves the  right to deny access or membership to any person who has been convicted of any  crime involving sexual abuse, is or has been a registered sex offender, has  ever been convicted of any offense relating to the use, sale, possession, or transportation  of narcotics or habit forming and/or dangerous drugs, chemicals, narcotics, or  intoxicating beverages. The YMCA also reserves the right to suspend access or  membership to any person accused of the items list above pending the outcome of  any charges or court proceedings. \\xa0  PROGRAM FEES & POLICIES PROGRAM FEES  Some of our programs are fee-based, which represents the cost of providing program activities or services not included in your membership dues. Specific fee information is available at your YMCA or at register.ymcachicago.org.

VISION Youth Guidance sees a bright and successful future for every inner-city elementary and high school student. Because we believe that success in school is not only possible but should be achieved and celebrated, we are present in schools to facilitate an environment that truly engages students in the learning process, and through careful guidance, enables them to realize their full potential and graduate with a meaningful plan for successfully managing life.  HISTORY Founded in 1924 as The Church Mission of Help, Youth Guidance was originally formed to assist girls in need of shelter, clothing, medical care, financial help, legal assistance, and educational/vocational opportunities. In 1962, the Church of Mission Help merged with an agency serving boys in family court and became Youth Guidance Youth Services. In 1969, we entered into a partnership with Chicago Public Schools (CPS) and established our first full-time offices within area\\xa0schools—laying the foundation for the innovative, school-based initiatives that are the cornerstone of the Youth Guidance of today. Remembering Former CEO Nancy Johnstone… TODAY Youth Guidance is a leading provider of outcomes-driven programs and capacity-building initiatives, directly serving more than 8,500 youth while\\xa0touching the lives of more than 14,000 youth, parents, teachers and community members. Our specific and strategically developed delivery areas are: Counseling & Prevention (BAM, WOW, STRIVE);\\xa0Community & Afterschool (Parent & Family Engagement, Full-Service Community Schools,\\xa0Extended Day & Enrichment); and Youth Workforce Development (Project Prepare and AmeriCorps). Each area is mission-oriented, carrying its own targets and benchmarks. \\xa0Each is vital to the agency’s success. To access Youth Guidance on GuideStar, please\\xa0click here.

In order to remain faithful to our mission, Catholic Charities is guided by these core values: Respect, Compassion, Competence and Stewardship.\\n\\nOur mission and values are based on the firm foundation of Catholic Social Teaching, a collection of themes developed in papal and other writings over the course of the Church’s history. These themes include the belief that human life is sacred; that all humans have inherent dignity, rights and responsibilities; that social structures like marriage and the family must be supported; that the needs of the poor and vulnerable must be met; and that we must be responsible stewards of God’s creation.\\n\\nFar from limiting our focus, our Catholic identity and values enable us to truly be “universal,” which is what “catholic” really means. The tenets of Catholic Social Teaching call us to serve everyone, regardless of their belief or background, and to employ anyone, not just Catholics, who commits to our mission. Christ reached out to people of all faiths, and Catholic Charities does the same, with the goal of transforming lives for the better. About Us:  Who We Are What We Do Our Supporters ',\n",
       "       \"\\neconomicprogress.org  Follow economicprogress.org on: Donate About Rethinking the EITC The Problem The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is our nation's largest federal anti-poverty program for families with children, reaching one in five workers, or 28 million households. In Illinois, more than one million households claimed the EITC in 2014, generating $2.5 billion in refunds. Under current law, the EITC – worth up to $6,143 per household - is available only as a lump-sum credit payable after a tax return is filed - a few months after the end of the year in which the credit was earned. For many working families, their EITC refund is larger than their regular paycheck, and their overall tax refund can be between 20% and 40% of their annual take-home pay. Living paycheck to paycheck for most of the year, most families have spent their refund within several months, however they continue to experience financial instability the rest of the year.  These constraints can cause families to often rely on short-term, high cost credit – payday and auto title loans and high interest credit cards  – or even forego paying bills which can result in expensive late fees and penalties. Our Solution Recognizing these limitations of the EITC as a once-a-year, lump-sum refund payment, CEP proposes a periodic payment option that allows taxpayers with children to claim a portion of the EITC during the year it is earned. By having up to 50% of the federal EITC paid out in four installments in the year it is earned rather than in the subsequent year when a tax return is filed, CEP believes that recipients will be able to better address income\\xa0volatility, reduce reliance on high-cost credit and save for the future. CEP tested this hypothesis in Chicago through its Chicago Periodic EITC Payment Pilot. This pilot was a research collaboration with the City of Chicago, Chicago Housing Authority and the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign conducted in 2014 and 2015. \\xa0 Early results from the pilot are now available and are overwhelmingly positive.\\xa0 Participants, when compared to a control group, relied less on credit cards and payday loans, experienced less stress, invested more funds in their children and saved more.\\xa0 Most significantly, 90% indicated that they prefer a periodic payment EITC versus the current lump sum refund.

Our History In the early years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the US, nearly 100 activists met at the historic Baton Show Lounge to address the dire need for housing for Chicagoans living with AIDS. \\xa0On September 9, 1985, Chicago House was incorporated in Illinois as a not-for-profit with the goal of providing housing for those with AIDS. A Chicago House float in the Pride Parade, 1988 During the 1980s, Chicago House emerged as an organization providing a compassionate response to a fearful disease. \\xa0We built our infrastructure as we established several facilities to meet the growing and ever-evolving needs of our clients. \\xa0Our first residence, opened in February 1986 in Uptown, accommodated eight individuals in private bedrooms with shared cooking, dining, bathing, and living areas. \\xa0\\xa0We opened two more residences in 1987 and, responding to demand, a 24-hour care program and hospice in 1988 for clients in need of additional support. \\xa0In 1992, Chicago House formed the Family Support Program, becoming the first provider of housing and related services to HIV-affected families. Before advances in HIV medication, these early years often meant that we were providing our clients a place to die with dignity after they had been abandoned by friends and family or forced out of their apartments. \\xa0An early agency newsletter from 1986 reads, “Through May 15, 1987, Chicago House has provided a home for 28 individuals, all men…. Of the 17 men no longer with Chicago House, 10 are deceased. ” \\xa0In these early years, Chicago House was the last home many people had before they died. Early interior of a housing unit in Chicago’s West Town The latter half of the 1990’s, however, ushered in new hope as medical advances came to the fore with the advent of new drug therapies. \\xa0As drug advances and approvals began to dominate the news in the AIDS community, increased hope was also somewhat tempered by the reality that the annual cost of drug therapy could easily exceed $20,000 per person. In 2000, the annual AIDS death toll in the United States dropped to 17,741 after it had peaked in 1995 at over 48,000. \\xa0Many people with HIV/AIDS found themselves getting better and were confronted with the reality that they now faced rebuilding their lives while living with HIV rather than preparing to die. \\xa0In 1997, we bought the building that would house our Independent Living Program, responding to the need that many of those living with HIV/AIDS presented – to live in a more independent supportive housing program. Then, in 1999, after experiencing empty beds in our hospice facility and increased demand in our other housing programs, Chicago House made the difficult decision to close down the hospice. \\xa0Chicago House’s hospice provided essential and compassionate care to over 400 people. \\xa0In the four housing facilities that we currently operate, Chicago House now provides permanent supportive housing to more than 100 people each year. \\xa0 We also provide these residents, along with those living independently in the community, with vital case management services. In 2004, Chicago House became the lead agency on a 5-year project funded by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). \\xa0Running this program, Chicago House helped our HIV-positive clients reach out and protect their peers and partners from infection. \\xa0Chicago House continues to run a CDC-funded Prevention With Positives intervention that, in 2013, reached 110 people. Also in 2004, U.S. Senator Dick Durbin visited Chicago House to learn more about our programs and the needs of our clients. \\xa0The residents he met with expressed their desire to return to work, but explained the major obstacles that they faced. After listening to their concerns and the efforts of the agency, Senator Durbin helped facilitate a start-up grant to support the initial development and implementation of an HIV employment service system, which became our Employment Services\\xa0Program. \\xa0The program launched in the fall of 2005 with much support from leaders in the HIV and workforce development community and, since its inception, has served nearly 1,000 participants. In 2006, Chicago House began its Scattered-Site Housing Program, which provides rental assistance and support services to clients. \\xa0Initially offering 18 apartment units connecting people to housing and employment services, the Scattered-Site Housing Program now manages about 150 units each year. 2013 was another momentous year for Chicago House as we officially launched the TransLife Center (TLC), responding to the great need for culturally-competent, expert social services specifically for transgender individuals. \\xa0In the same facility that we once used as a hospice in the early years of the HIV epidemic, we now deliver housing, employment, linkage-to-medical care, case management, and legal services. \\xa0With community partners, we are currently leading a 5-year Special Project of National Significance funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration to study the link between HIV and retention in care in transgender women of color.

I challenge each one of us to be visionaries. Partner with us — invest in our mission and envision a county where everyone can have a place to call home. Gratefully, Carol Simler\\nExecutive Director DuPagePads is so much more than a pad on the floor. DuPagePads is about the journey home. It’s about the journey from dependency to self-sufficiency. Not the shelter. Not the nights spent in a car, in a motel room or on the street. DuPagePads is a journey that begins with an extended hand, an affirming voice, and a trusting soul that will advocate undividedly for each individual. The solution to end homelessness. Starts with housing. The solution to end homelessness is more complex than providing individuals with food and shelter. Founded in 1985, DuPagePads is the largest provider of interim and permanent housing, coupled with support services in order to help individuals work toward becoming self-sufficient. These vital support services enable the individuals we help to receive case management and life coaching, employment support such as\\xa0job coaching, as well as engagement with employers—effectively stopping the cycle of homelessness. DuPagePads IS the solution to end homelessness—because when someone believes in you, everything can change.  Click here to find more success stories.

       "       '   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  Lutheran Day 2015: Becoming Participants\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t One hundred advocates from nine Lutheran agencies joined together in the state capital on April 14 for Lutheran Day 2015 and exercised their right to care about their neighbors. \\xa0 “By answering Jesus’ call, we stop being spectators and become participants,” said Pr. Yehiel Curry in the opening devotion of the morning program. A panel educated advocates. John Bouman of the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law told advocates that 91% of the Illinois budget is services, and we must find an adequate and fair way to pay for those. Judith Gethner of Illinois Partners for Human Services, in response to the proposed cuts to human services, said, “People don’t go away just because you shut down a program.” Consultant in healthcare financing and former state Medicaid Director George Hovanec noted that 99.9% of public leaders believe that some kind of new tax revenue is needed and encouraged Lutheran agency boards to consider taking a position in support. \\xa0 Rachael Stevens of LCFS in Mt. Vernon illustrated the impact of state-funded services as she told a story of accomplishment over a two-and-half-year period, thanks to a resilient 16 year old in foster care and his dedicated foster parents. In the afternoon, advocates moved about the capitol, meeting with legislators and advocating for doubling the Illinois Earned Income Tax Credit. In the capitol rotunda, Bishop S. John Roth led advocates in prayer for public officials and Illinois residents. \\xa0 LCFS President and CEO Gene Svebakken joined Bonnie Condon of Advocate Health Care and other agency leaders to congratulate winners of the Paul Simon Courage in Public Service Award: the late Illinois Comptroller Judy Baar Topinka (represented by Nancy Kimme) and Illinois State Senator Dan Kotowski. \\xa0 Photos:Lutheran Day 2015 photos Navigation Links Contact Us \\r\\n                        \\tLutheran Child and Family Services of Illinois \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t7620 Madison Street\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRiver Forest, IL 60305\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPhone : 708-771-7180\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFax : 708-771-7184\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEmail : lcfs_info@lcfs.org \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCentral Intake and Information & \\r\\n                            Referral: 800-363-LCFS (5237) \\n Hours ',\n",

However, after more than two decides at the school, Crys decided it was time for a change and began to pursue a career more aligned with her education! While working with National Able Network, Crys learned how to craft a resume in today’s job market, as well as how to incorporate new job search methods. Through her hard work and commitment, Crys was offered a position in higher education! When asked about her new career, Crys said: “The people are wonderful. It is encouraging; I never really got that holistically in other positions. I have room to grow.”  Shawn Crump Shawn Crump’s primary goals when he came to National Able Network were to earn his bachelor’s degree, obtain additional certifications, and build relationships with\\xa0Information Technology industry professionals that would lead to a stable and fulfilling career. While working with his Career Coach, Kenneth Jones, Shawn was able to earn his bachelor’s degree and attended job fairs where he was able to build his network! It was at one of these job fairs that Shawn made a career-changing connection. Through hard work and a “never-give-up” attitude, Shawn is now happily employed and is continuing to support his family of seven! \\xa0  Davita White Davita White was out of work for more than a year when she heard about National Able Network through a former co-worker. She was hoping that Able could help her pursue better job leads, improve her interview skills, and find a way to “sell herself on paper.” Able met and exceeded Davita’s expectations! She began taking classes to improve her social media, networking, and interview skills, all while following job leads from her career coach. Davita also became an active participant in her Job Search Work Team, where she met with fellow job seekers to get feedback regarding her job search. Davita felt her time at Able advanced her skills dramatically! Her improved networking skills helped her learn about a job she thought she would be perfect for: HR Administrative Coordinator. Sure enough, Davita was right! She is now back in the workforce and loving every minute of it!   Richard Gutierrez Richard was looking for career guidance after being laid off from his job as a truck driver and quickly realized that working in Information Technology was a no-brainer for him. He enrolled in IT Career Lab and was impressed by the program; not only was it immersive and fast-paced, but the subject matter was complex! While at times it was challenging to try and absorb so much information so fast, Richard worked hard and received his Cisco Certified Entry Networking Technician (CCENT) certification. Since leaving IT Career Lab, he has been hard at work in IT, doing contract work as a PC technician! Richard is quick to praise Able for helping him figure out where he wanted to go, and then help him get there: “Able held my hand through the entire process.”  MARCIA GREEN  After being laid off from her job as a real estate closing coordinator, Marcia Green was very motivated to get back to work quickly because she is the primary caregiver of her disabled husband: “[A job search] can be very scary when people are obligated to you. It can be tiring, and as you get older it gets more challenging, you have to find new strategies and set new expectations,” said Marcia.  To support her new strategy, Marcia came to National Able Network, enrolled in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) and began working with Career Coach, Rocio Montoya. Rocio helped her update her resume and locate job fair information and other resources. Marcia also joined a Job Search Work Team, a group of fellow job seekers who discuss their job search progress with one another. Thanks to her focus and updated skills, Marcia is back in the real estate industry working as an administrative assistant! Great work, Marcia! \\xa0     About Us Calendar Support Us Mission Moments Join Our Mailing List Receive our newsletters, breaking news alerts, and more!

       "       'ABOUT US OUR MISSION The mission of the Restaurant Opportunities Centers (ROC) United is to improve wages and working conditions for the nation’s restaurant workforce. We are 18,000 restaurant workers, 200 high-road employers, thousands of engaged consumers united for raising restaurant industry standards. OUR HISTORY The Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York was\\xa0initially founded in New York City by Fekkak Mamdouh and Saru Jayaraman after September 11th, 2001 to provide support to restaurant workers displaced as a result of the World Trade Center tragedy. Based on our successful efforts in New York City, restaurant workers in several other cities approached ROC about initiating chapters\\xa0in their cities. Thus, in 2008 we launched the\\xa0Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, which\\xa0has grown into a national organization with 18,000 low-wage restaurant worker members in 15 states. Since its founding, ROC United has won more than a dozen workplace justice campaigns, winning more than $10 million in misappropriated tips and wages and discrimination payments for low-wage workers, and significant policy changes in high-profile restaurant companies covering thousands of workers. We have played\\xa0an instrumental role in winning statewide minimum wage increases for tipped workers, and other policy campaigns at the local, state, and federal levels. ROC also partners with almost 200 responsible restaurant owners to promote the ‘high road’ to profitability, has trained more than 5,000 restaurant workers to advance to livable-wage jobs within the industry, and has published over 30 ground-breaking reports and a nationally bestselling book on the restaurant industry. OUR TEAM CO-DIRECTORS & CO-FOUNDERS\\n Saru Jayaraman Co-Director (based in Oakland, California), co-founded ROC in New York after 9/11, together with displaced World Trade Center workers, which has organized restaurant workers to win workplace justice campaigns, conduct research and policy work, partner with responsible restaurants, and launch cooperatively-owned restaurants.  Fekkak Mamdouh Fekkak Mamdouh came to the United States from Morocco in 1988 at the age of 27. He worked in New York City restaurants since he arrived, and finally moved to Windows on the World when it reopened in 1996. As a waiter at Windows, Mamdouh was always a staunch worker advocate.

Quentin Road, Suite 103\\r\\nPalatine, Illinois 60067  Send us an e-mail (847) 359-7490 Call today to schedule an appointment. Contact Us About Us In 1965, a progressive group of community leaders identified an emerging community problem—existing counseling programs and other social services were not meeting the growing needs of youth. The Beginning Palatine Township became the second township in the state of Illinois to appoint a youth committee. Over the next few years, the committee opened a drop-in center, began outreach work and started a summer employment program. When the Simon and Garfunkle song Bridge Over Troubled Waters became popular, the youth named the agency The Bridge. The Bridge Youth Services became the official name of the organization in 1976. A Safe Place What started as a safe place for youth in our community to gather has evolved into a comprehensive mental health resource for youth and their families in the Northwest Suburbs. Today the Bridge provides a continuum of services including family and individual counseling, mentoring, social skills and trauma recovery groups, parenting workshops, and more. Funding Needs We are proud to develop programs and services in response to community need. When public funding is limited in amount and scope, it is important for The Bridge to focus on developing new financial resources to not only maintain but also grow services. Private funding is essential to The Bridge so we may continue to offer services matched to individual needs, regardless of one’s ability to pay. ',\n",

       "       'Mission & Values A Mission Rooted in Catholic Social Teaching: We Serve Everyone Regardless of Faith... \\nCatholic Charities fulfills the Church’s role in the mission of charity to anyone in need by providing compassionate, competent and professional services that strengthen and support individuals, families and communities based on the value and dignity of human life. In order to remain faithful to our mission, Catholic Charities is guided by these core values: Respect, Compassion, Competence and Stewardship.\\n\\nOur mission and values are based on the firm foundation of Catholic Social Teaching, a collection of themes developed in papal and other writings over the course of the Church’s history. These themes include the belief that human life is sacred; that all humans have inherent dignity, rights and responsibilities; that social structures like marriage and the family must be supported; that the needs of the poor and vulnerable must be met; and that we must be responsible stewards of God’s creation.\\n\\nFar from limiting our focus, our Catholic identity and values enable us to truly be “universal,” which is what “catholic” really means. The tenets of Catholic Social Teaching call us to serve everyone, regardless of their belief or background, and to employ anyone, not just Catholics, who commits to our mission. Christ reached out to people of all faiths, and Catholic Charities does the same, with the goal of transforming lives for the better. About Us:  Who We Are What We Do Our Supporters ',\n",

       "       \"About Us Mission IMAN is a community organization that fosters health, wellness and healing in the inner-city by organizing for social change, cultivating the arts and operating a holistic health center.  History IMAN, incorporated in 1997, was founded by an inter-generational group of students, residents, and organizers united around the need to address violence, poverty, and decay in the Chicago Lawn neighborhood located on Chicago’s southwest side. Driven by their values of service, compassion, and social justice, they began a community assessment and examined alternative strategies to address these conditions. Soon they gathered the attention of community leaders, residents, and others across greater Chicago who shared their commitment to social change. Over the years, the organization’s work has continued to organically evolve.\\xa0Currently, IMAN operates a community health center; provides transitional housing and job training for formerly incarcerated men; empowers local youth through leadership development and civic engagement; and inspire change through arts and culture programming. Vision To serve as the model of the Muslim tradition of facilitating transformational change in urban communities, by inspiring others towards critical civic engagement exemplifying prophetic compassion in the work for social justice and human dignity beyond the barriers of religion, ethnicity, and nationality. 2014 Audit Report\\n2014 Form 990\\n2013 Audit Report\\n2012 Audit Report  \\xa0 Spiritual reflection & discussion around the police accountability reform organizing work in Chicago this morning pic.twitter.com/nze3… Don't miss our live chat on Monday w/ Anthony Romero @ACLU Stewart Kwoh @AAAJ_LA & @RamiNashashibi @imancentral!… twitter.com/i/web/st… @NHSChicago 42nd annual awards dinner - shoutout to #revitalizingsouthwestChicago! @SWOPorg @GreaterSW @imancentral 2013 Audited Financials 2012 Audited Financials 2011 Audited Financials 2011 Form 990 2010 Audited Financials 2010 Form 990 2009 Audited Financials 2009 Form 990 Annual Report 2010-11 Annual Report 2008-09 Annual Report 2007 Recent Awards 500 Most Influential Muslims in the World\\nThe Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre and Georgetown University\\nAmir Al-Islam & Rami Nashashibi Courageous Voices Award\\nJewish Council on Urban Affairs\\nRami Nashashibi Norman Bobins Leadership Award, Chicago Neighborhood Development Awards\\nRami Nashashibi Excellence in Community Leadership Award\\nHoly Cross Hospital\\nRafi Peterson Community Hero\\nLocal Initiatives Support Corporation\\nClyde El Amin & Rafi Peterson Outstanding Community Service Award\\nCouncil of Islamic Organizations of Greater Chicago\\nNia Odeoti-Hassan & Rami Nashashibi Service to the IHRC Recognition Award\\nInternational Human Relations Council & Chicago Commission on Human Relations\\nVeronica Zapata Community Organizing Award\\nChicago Community Trust\\nIMAN & the Developing Justice Coalition 2009 Audited Financials 2009 Form 990 \",\n",

       "       'The Josselyn Center Mental Health for Clients. Hope for Families. Healing for Communities. About the Josselyn Center The Josselyn Center is dedicated to improving the quality of life for all our clients. Here is what you can expect. Comprehensive services We are one of the few resources in the area that offer both therapeutic services and psychiatric services, including medication management, on a sliding fee scale to those who qualify. We are one of the few agencies in the United States that will provide psychiatric services for clients who receive therapy at another agency. Our staff includes a wide range of clinical professionals, including clinical social workers, psychologists, psychoeduational testing experts, psychiatrists, clinical counselors and case managers. This breadth allows us to craft a treatment plan that addresses the specific complexity and severity of each client’s needs, thus ensuring a broad base of excellent opinions resulting in an individualized treatment plan. This comprehensive approach also means an individual can be served at the same location simultaneously by multiple clinical disciplines. A caring and expert staff We are very selective about who we hire. We want people who are properly trained and skilled. That is why all of our therapists are licensed. Equally as important, we seek to hire only people who are passionate about helping others and exhibit warmth, compassion and patience when interacting with our clients. Affordable The Josselyn Center accepts Medicare, Medicaid and many private insurance plans. For the client portion of the payment, we have a sliding fee based on income for those who qualify. In fact, The Josselyn Center is the only resource in our area that provides psychiatric assessment, intervention and maintenance services, case management and referral services and individual counseling all on a sliding fee basis to those who qualify. In most cases, the individuals we are privileged to see would not be able to receive services if not for The Josselyn Center. Accessible We do not have a waiting list. We are ready to serve you whenever you need us. In addition to our daytime hours, we also offer evening hours, so you do not have to worry about school or work schedules.

       "       \"ABOUT US About Us  What We Do 360 Youth Services provides life-changing services through substance abuse prevention education, counseling and housing. Counseling Programs Our Counseling services are as varied as the issues that arise for those having difficulty at home, school, or in the community. Trained therapists provide a variety of professional counseling services for school-aged youth and families, as well as young adults. Educational groups for youth of all ages and their parents are also offered. Some issues addressed include depression, anxiety, grief, family conflict, life transitions, self-esteem and parenting. Specialized services for high-risk youth are also available. Many insurance plans are accepted and special accommodations can be arranged\\xa0for families who are struggling financially.  Mentor Programs The pressures on today’s youth are greater than any other previous generation. Mentors work with young adults who currently live in one of 360 Youth Services’ housing programs. Prevention Programs 360 Youth Services is dedicated to substance abuse education and prevention services for students in school districts 203 & 204 and their parents. Through two highly recognized and applauded programs – The Power of Choice and Operation Snowball, staff teach and promote that when a community consistently supports its students’ healthy choices, the number of kids making good decisions about substance use actually increases. Housing Programs When housing is uncertain, everything in a young person’s life seems\\xa0to fall apart. At 360 Youth Services, housing and support services are provided to young adults, 18-24 years old, who were previously homeless, and teenage boys, 13-17 years old, who are unable to live with their families.

If you make a gift of stock, won’t you please let us know? While 360 Youth Services gratefully accepts all gifts, including anonymous ones, it is very important for us to know the identity of the donors of all gifts in order to give prompt and accurate credit for gifts received.

In order to remain faithful to our mission, Catholic Charities is guided by these core values: Respect, Compassion, Competence and Stewardship.\\n\\nOur mission and values are based on the firm foundation of Catholic Social Teaching, a collection of themes developed in papal and other writings over the course of the Church’s history. These themes include the belief that human life is sacred; that all humans have inherent dignity, rights and responsibilities; that social structures like marriage and the family must be supported; that the needs of the poor and vulnerable must be met; and that we must be responsible stewards of God’s creation.\\n\\nFar from limiting our focus, our Catholic identity and values enable us to truly be “universal,” which is what “catholic” really means. The tenets of Catholic Social Teaching call us to serve everyone, regardless of their belief or background, and to employ anyone, not just Catholics, who commits to our mission. Christ reached out to people of all faiths, and Catholic Charities does the same, with the goal of transforming lives for the better. About Us:  Who We Are What We Do Our Supporters ',\n",

Supportive housing and services offer women their key to healing, achieving their goals and moving on from the experience of homelessness. We seek to fulfill our mission through the expression of our core values: Our History Since 1985, Deborah’s Place has provided compassionate care to women experiencing homelessness. In that time, we’ve continually improved our programs and services. Deborah’s Place began by offering emergency overnight shelter in a church gym. Responding to the needs of participants, the overnight shelter was followed with a day program called Irene’s. Here, women could begin healing from trauma through art therapy and other resources. Following the day program, Marah’s was opened as a transitional housing program in 1988. With Marah’s, Deborah’s Place took an important step towards providing a safe environment 24 hours a day. This strategic direction towards more comprehensive services continued as we began offering case management and developing our first permanent supportive housing, which opened in 1995.

       "       \"About Us About Life Span  Statement of Philosophy Life Span provides comprehensive services for women and children enabling them to stay together without violence, and/or to help women eliminate the abuse from their lives, build upon their strengths, and become self-sufficient. Life Span is committed to providing victims of abuse a range of non-residential options by defining domestic violence as a crime as well as a social problem. Life Span is also committed to reducing community acceptance and tolerance of abuse and increasing community awareness of domestic violence and sexual violence. Life Span provides community education and technical assistance to ensure responsive and appropriate treatment and delivery of public services to victims of domestic and sexual violence. History Life Span was founded in 1978 by a coalition of women and organizations in the North and Northwest suburbs of Cook County to address the urgent need of battered women in the area for services. In the last 34 years, Life Span has grown from a small, grass roots agency staffed by an Executive Director and a legion of volunteers to an agency employing 25 people. Our agency has grown from one which provided group counseling to one which is a leader in the provision of expert services from counseling and criminal court advocacy to legal representation in all types of family law cases.  Life Span has created a number of innovative programs, including the Police Project, the Target Abuser Call Project in conjunction with the State's Attorneys Office, and the Immigration Project. In addition, we are also the only agency in Illinois, and possibly the country, to put into practice Civil No Contact Orders for sexual assault survivors. Throughout our history, Life Span has been true to its original mission, the eradication of domestic and sexual violence in the lives of its individual clients and in society. Our direct domestic and sexual violence services work toward this goal.  In our advocacy and policy work, we use what we have learned from helping our clients, to create systems of change that positively impact survivors of domestic and sexual violence.

       "       'Domestic Violence About Domestic Violence  Fact: Domestic violence crosses all age, ethnic, socioeconomic, religious, and educational boundaries.  There are doctors, ministers, psychologists, police, attorneys, judges, and other professionals who beat their partners. Battering also occurs in same gender relationships. Domestic violence is virtually impossible to measure with absolute precision due to numerous complications including the societal stigma that inhibits victims from disclosing their abuse and the varying definitions of abuse used from study to study. Estimates range from 960,000 incidents of violence against a current or former spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend per year to 3.9 million women who are physically abused each year.  Thirty percent of Americans say they know a woman who has been physically abused by her husband or boyfriend in the past year. An abusive relationship can be defined as one in which a partner uses a pattern of assaultive and coercive behaviors to maintain power and control over the other partner.  This includes couples who are married or unmarried, gay or straight.  Types of abuse can include physical, emotional, social, economic, and sexual. Cycle of Violence Phase 1 – Tension Building A victim often senses that the abuser is becoming edgy and more prone to lash out at trivial frustrations. The victim may learn to anticipate abuse and try to control it by being more nurturing and compliant or by simply staying out of the abuser’s way. This phase is marked by many “minor” abusive actions that gradually increase in severity. Quite often the event which will trigger the battering phase is initiated by the abuser who may make a demand which the victim cannot meet, and responds to her/his refusal or inability to act with violent behavior. Abuse victims often accept the building rage in a partner as being legitimately directed towards her/him. The victim internalizes the responsibility of keeping the situation from exploding.  If she/he does their job well, the abusive partner will become or remain calm; if she/he fails, the victim believes it is their own fault.   A victim who has been battered over time knows that she/he can do nothing to stop the tension from building, but often denies this knowledge to help cope with the partner’s behavior. Phase 2 – Acute Battering Incident (Explosive Incident) When the abuser finally becomes violent, the severity of the assault and where it occurs is impossible to predict.  This phase is characterized by explosive and unpredictable rage. This may involve pushing, shoving, shaking, or hair pulling.  It may involve hitting with an open hand or a closed fist. It may involve intense yelling and name calling.  It may be over in a moment or last for hours.  If the assault has been physical, there may be visible injuries, but often an experienced batterer will leave no marks.  The attack rarely takes a single consistent form. The attack is followed by shock, denial and disbelief.  Most victims consider themselves lucky that it was not worse, no matter how bad their injuries are. They often deny the seriousness of their injuries and refuse to seek medical help if it is needed. The abuser denies violence, and justifes the behavior by saying the original intent was to simply teach the victim a lesson, and she/he “just lost control.” Phase 3 – Aftermath: Loving Respite (Re-engagement Phase) Victims may enter the criminal justice system after an acute battering episode, but after the assault comes a period of calm, loving, contrite behavior. Both the abuser and the victim feel guilty about the event and resolve never to “let” it happen again. The batterer will very typically treat the victim with apparent respect, love and affection.  This is a great relief for the victim and is precisely what was desired from the relationship all along. The abuser apologizes for what happened and asks for forgiveness. The abuser may even believe she/he will not do it again. The abuser promises to control her/himself and will never again hurt the partner she/he loves.  An abuser may even agree to go to therapy (but will usually drop out when the relationship resumes the tension building phase). The abuser tells the victim that she/he would fall apart without them, and  the victim wants to believe she/he will no longer have to suffer abuse.  An abuser’s reasonableness and loving behavior during this period support the victim’s wish that the partner can really change.  The victim takes responsibility for their abuser’s well-being and for the abuse.   If the victim has filed charges against the “reformed” partner, she/he may consider dropping them.  As long as the abusive partner continues to behave affectionately, the victim becomes increasingly reluctant to jeopardize such good behavior by proceeding with a prosecution or anything considered a disturbance to the relationship.

Employment Victims’ Economic Security and Safety Act (VESSA): Victims of sexual assault may be eligible to take time off work to attend court, seek counseling, or see a doctor.

    "To clean and normalize text, we'll remove all special characters, numbers, and punctuation, so we're left with only the words themselves. Then we will make all the text lowercase; this uniformity will ensure that the algorithm doesn't treat \"the\" and \"The\" as different words, for example. \n",

    "**Regular Expressions**, or \"regexes\" for short, let you find all the words or phrases in a document or text file that match a certain pattern. These rules are useful for pulling out useful information from a large amount of text. For example, if you want to find all email addresses in a document, you might look for everything that looks like *some combination of letters, _, .* followed by *@*, followed by more letters, and ending in *.com* or *.edu*. If you want to find all the credit card numbers in a document, you might look for everywhere you see the pattern \"four numbers, space, four numbers, space, four numbers, space, four numbers.\" Regexes are also helpful if you are scraping information from websites, because you can use them to separate the content from the HTML code used for formatting the website.\n",

    "\n",
    "*A word of warning:* Regexes can work much more quickly than plain text sorting; however, if your regular expressions are becoming overly complicated, it's a good idea to find a simpler way to do what you want to do. Any developer should keep in mind there is a trade-off between optimization and understandability. The general philosophy of programming in Python is that your code is meant to be as understandable by *people* as much as possible, because human time is more valuable than computer time. You should therefore lean toward understandability rather than overly optimizing your code to make it run as quickly as possible. Your future-self, code-reviewers, people who inherit your code, and anyone else who has to make sense of your code in the future will appreciate it. \n",

    "### Stopwords\n",
    "\n",
    "Stopwords are words that are found commonly throughout a text and carry little semantic meaning. Examples of common stopwords are prepositions, articles and common nouns. For example, the words *the* and *of* are totally ubiquitous, so they won't serve as meaningful features, whether to distinguish documents from each other or to tell what a given document is about. You may also run into words that you want to remove based on where you obtained your corpus of text or what it's about. There are many lists of common stopwords available for you to use, both for general documents and for specific contexts, so you don't have to start from scratch.   \n",

Notice how the top words include words like \"services,\" \"youth,\" \"community,\" \"mission\"? It makes sense that these words are so common, but we'd expect to see them in every website in our corpus - after all, we're looking at websites of social service organizations in Chicago! - so they won't be very helpful in analysis. \n",

    "Previously, we used topic modeling to infer relationships between social service facilities within the data. That is an example of unsupervised learning: we were looking to uncover structure in the form of topics, or groups of agencies, but we did not necessarily know the ground truth of how many groups we should find or which agencies belonged in which group.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we turn our attention to supervised learning. In supervised learning, we have a *known* outcome or label (*Y*) that we want to produce given some data (*X*), and in general, we want to be able to produce this *Y* when we *don't* know it, or when we *only* have *X*. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to produce labels we need to first have examples our algorithm can learn from, a \"training set.\" In the context of text analysis, developing a training set can be very expensive, as it can require a large amount of human labor or linguistic expertise. **Document classification** is an example of supervised learning in which want to characterize our documents based on their contents (*X*). A common example of document classification is spam e-mail detection. Another example of supervised learning in text analysis is *sentiment analysis*, where *X* is our documents and *Y* is the state of the author. This \"state\" is dependent on the question you're trying to answer, and can range from the author being happy or unhappy with a product to the author being politically conservative or liberal. Another example is *part-of-speech tagging* where *X* are individual words and *Y* is the part-of-speech. \n",

    "If we examine our precision-recall curve we can see that our precision is 1 up to 40 percent of the population. We can use a \"precision at *k*\" curve to see what percent of the corpus can be tagged by the classifier, and which should undergo a manual clerical review. Based on this curve, we might say that we can use our classifier to tag the 25% of the documents that have the highest scores as 1, and manually review the rest. \n",

    "## Cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the machine learning tutorial that we are seeking the find the most general pattern in the data in order to have to most general model that will be successful at classifying new unseen data. Our previous strategy above was the *Out-of-sample and holdout set*. With this strategy we try to find a general pattern by randomly dividing our data into a test and training set based on some percentage split (e.g., 50-50 or 80-20). We train on the test set and evaluate on the test set, where we pretend that we don't have the labels for the test set. A significant drawback with this approach is that we may be lucky or unlucky with our random split, and so our estimate of how we'd perform on truly new data is overly optimistic or overly pessimistic. A possible solution is to create many random splits into training and testing sets and evaluate each split to estimate the performance of a given model. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more sophisticated holdout training and testing procedure is *cross-validation*. In cross-validation we split our data into *k* folds or partitions, where *k* is usually 5 or 10. We then iterate k times. In each iteration, one of the folds is used as a test set, and the rest of the folds are combined to form the training set. We can then evaluate the performance at each iteration to estimate the performance of a given method. An advantage of using cross-validation is all examples of data are used in the training set at least once. \n"

      "mission and history our mission chicago house and social service agency serves individuals and families who are disenfranchised by hiv aids lgbtq marginalization poverty homelessness and or gender nonconformity by providing housing employment services medical linkage and retention services hiv prevention services legal services and other supportive programs our history in the early years of the hiv aids epidemic in the us nearly   activists met at the historic baton show lounge to address the dire need for housing for chicagoans living with aids on september     chicago house was incorporated in illinois as not for profit the goal of providing housing for those with aids a chicago house float in the pride parade   during the  s chicago house emerged as an organization providing a compassionate response to a fearful disease we built our infrastructure as we established several facilities to meet the growing and ever evolving needs of our clients our first residence opened in february   in uptown accommodated   individuals in private bedrooms with shared cooking dining bathing and living areas we opened two more residences in   and responding to demand a   hour care program and hospice in   for clients in need of additional support in   chicago house formed the family support program becoming the first provider of housing and related services to hiv affected families before advances in hiv medication these early years often meant that we were providing our clients a place to die with dignity after they had been abandoned by friends and family or forced out of their apartments an early agency newsletter from   reads through may     chicago house has provided a home for   individuals all men of the   men no longer with chicago house   are deceased in these early years chicago house was the last home many people had before they died early interior of a housing unit in chicago s west town the latter half of the   s however ushered in new hope as medical advances came to the fore with the advent of new drug therapies as drug advances and approvals began to dominate the news in the aids community increased hope was also somewhat tempered by the reality that the annual cost of drug therapy could easily exceed     per person in   the annual aids death toll in the united states dropped to     after it had peaked in   at over     many people with hiv aids found themselves getting better and were confronted with the reality that they now faced rebuilding their lives while living with hiv rather than preparing to die in   we bought the building that would house our independent living program responding to then need that many of those living with hiv aids had to live in a more independent supportive housing program then in   after experiencing empty beds in our hospice facility and increased demand in our other housing programs chicago house made the difficult decision to close down the hospice chicago house s hospice provided essential and compassionate care to over   people in the four housing facilities that we currently operate chicago house now provides permanent supportive housing to more than   people each year we also provide these residents along with those living independently in the community with vital case management services in   chicago house became the lead agency on a   year project funded by the centers for disease control cdc running this program chicago house helped our hiv positive clients reach out and protect their peers and partners from infection chicago house continues to run a cdc funded prevention with positives intervention that in   reached   people also in   u s senator dick durbin visited chicago house to learn more about our programs and the needs of our clients the residents he met with expressed their desire to return to work but explained the major obstacles that they faced after listening to their concerns and the efforts of the agency senator durbin helped facilitate a start up grant to support the initial development and implementation of an hiv employment service system which became our employment services program the program launched in the fall of   with much support from leaders in the hiv and workforce development community and since its inception has served nearly     participants chicago house began its scattered site housing program which provides rental assistance and support services to clients in   initially offering   apartment units connecting people to housing and employment services the scattered site housing program now manages about   units each year   was another momentous year for chicago house as we officially launched the translife center tlc responding to the great need for culturally competent expert social services specifically for transgender individuals in the same facility that we once used as a hospice in the early years of the hiv epidemic we now deliver housing employment linkage to medical care case management and legal services with community partners we are currently leading   year special project of national significance funded by the health resources and services adminsitration to study the
